# odin-linkedlist

This is a project set out by the Odin Project to create a linked list class and node class in ruby, to properly create a linked list functionality in the language.

Surprisingly, this project made a lot of sense to me, and I didn't take too long to grasp any of the concepts or create any of the functionality at all. I really enjoyed creating the linked list functionalities.

One thing that can be improved in the future is I can make a block/proc/lambda of code for just iterating through the list (checking if next is null, doing something or setting node to next and doing it again). That would improve readability and cut down on lines of code a lot.
